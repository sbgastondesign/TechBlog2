# Tech-Blog

CMS-style blog site that can publish articles and blog posts

## Goal

Create an application that follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Results:

I was able to successfully install all packages and follow the MVC paradigm. I was able to seed to database and run the back end. Handlebars is connected to the backend.
